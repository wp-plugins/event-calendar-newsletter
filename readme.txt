Format your events calendar into something you can easily put inside a newsletter

== Description ==

Take your events calendar feed and turn it into newsletter-friendly text!  No more manual copying and pasting from your calendar.

Compatible with:

* [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/)
* [Ajax Event Calendar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ajax-event-calendar/)

Is your calendar not supported or looking for other features?  Let me know in the support threads and I'll see what I can do!  Contributions also welcome.

Some additional features I'm considering:

* Easier text formatting
* Conditional formatting tags (ie. to show certain text for start time and end time, only if it's not an all-day event)
* Support for additional event calendars (such as Google Calendar)
* Direct integration with MailChimp, Constant Contact, and others to create newsletters
* Support for outputting events newsletter into a custom post type

But let me know in the support threads or by <a href="brian@brianhogg.com">email</a> what features you'd like to see.
