Format your events calendar into something you can easily put inside a newsletter

== Description ==

Take your events calendar feed and turn it into a newsletter-friendly format, so you can copy into your MailChimp, Constant Contact or other newsletter sending service.  No more manual copying, pasting and formatting from your calendar.

Compatible with:

* [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/)
* [Ajax Event Calendar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ajax-event-calendar/)

Want your event calendar supported?  <a href="mailto:brian@brianhogg.com">Let me know</a>.

Some additional features I'm considering:

* Easier text formatting
* Conditional formatting tags (ie. to show certain text for start time and end time, only if it's not an all-day event)
* Support for additional event calendars (such as Google Calendar)
* Direct integration with MailChimp, Constant Contact, and others to create newsletters
* Support for outputting events newsletter into a custom post type

But let me know in the support threads or by <a href="mailto:brian@brianhogg.com">email</a> what features you'd like to see.
